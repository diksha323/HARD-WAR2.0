# Smart Pillars

Road Safety is a big concern for police and such smart pillars will help to reduce accidents. This will be a useful installation where camera and other sensors will instantly alert drivers regarding the movement of vehicles so that they can take saftey precautions.

This project aims at number plate detection of vehicles on road using the ANPR technique and measure their speed in real-time.
The centralised data of over speeding vehicles is generated and  person is notified through whatsapp once the Automatic Challan is cut off. Additionally, the honking system installed alerts the drivers about approaching vehicles from the other blind fold end or U-turns.
